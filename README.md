# Python-Intermediate

This repository contains code examples and exercises for learning intermediate-level Python programming. The materials are aimed at learners who have already mastered the basics of Python and want to further develop their skills.

## Getting Started

To use the materials in this repository, you should have Python 3 installed on your computer and be familiar with the basics of Python. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-intermediate.git
```

Alternatively, you can download a ZIP archive of the repository and extract it to a local folder.

## Contents

The repository contains the following directories:

- `examples`: Code examples that demonstrate various intermediate-level Python concepts and features.
- `exercises`: Practice exercises for applying the concepts learned in the examples.
- `solutions`: Sample solutions for the exercises (provided for reference only).
- `tests`: Automated tests for the exercises (requires pytest library).

## Usage

You can run the example scripts by executing the Python interpreter with the filename as an argument:
```
python examples/advanced_data_types.py
```
You can run the exercises by editing the files in the `exercises` directory and running the corresponding test script in the `tests` directory:
```
python tests/test_advanced_data_types.py
```
The tests will check if your code produces the expected output for each exercise.

## Contributing

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improving the materials, you can create an issue on the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/your-username/python-intermediate/issues). You can also submit a pull request if you want to contribute code changes.

## Topics

This repository covers the following intermediate-level topics:

- Regular Expression
- Decorators
- Logging
- Iterable Objects
- Data Structure
- Comprehension
- Itertools
- Decorator
- Magic Functions
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Each of these topics is explained in detail through code examples and exercises in the `examples` and `exercises` directories. The examples demonstrate how to use the various Python concepts and features, while the exercises provide hands-on practice for applying the concepts in different scenarios.

By completing the examples and exercises, you should gain a deeper understanding of the Python language and be able to write more complex and efficient Python programs for various tasks.
